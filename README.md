# Twitter Transparent Avatar Uploader (Upic)

Use Twitter/X API to upload a transparent avatar to prevent the background color from being changed to white when using Twitter/X official client.

This is a full-stack project. You can deploy it by yourself or use the [online service](https://upic.3kn.jp/) provided by me.
